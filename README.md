# Symmetric-Encryption
This project demonstrates the use of cryptographic techniques, specifically symmetric encryption, to securely store and retrieve sensitive data in cloud environments. It uses Pythonâ€™s cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt a text file (secret.txt). The encrypted file can be stored securely in any environment, ensuring data confidentiality.
