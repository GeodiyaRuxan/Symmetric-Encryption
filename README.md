# Symmetric-Encryption
This project demonstrates the use of cryptographic techniques, specifically symmetric encryption, to securely store and retrieve sensitive data in cloud environments. It uses Pythonâ€™s cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt a text file (secret.txt). The encrypted file can be stored securely in any environment, ensuring data confidentiality.
# Cryptography in Secure Cloud Computing

This project demonstrates the use of cryptographic techniques, specifically symmetric encryption, to securely store and retrieve sensitive data in cloud environments. The goal is to showcase how encryption can ensure data confidentiality while working with cloud storage services.

## Features
- Symmetric encryption using the cryptography library in Python.
- Ability to encrypt and decrypt text files securely.
- Integration of a simple encryption algorithm to protect sensitive data.
- Option to extend the project to cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for secure file storage.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (for encryption)
- Symmetric encryption algorithm (AES)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-cloud-cryptography.git
