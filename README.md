## Introduction

Cryptography plays a critical role in ensuring data security, particularly in cloud computing, where data is often stored and transmitted over the internet. This project uses the `cryptography` library in Python to demonstrate how symmetric encryption techniques can be applied to protect sensitive data before it's uploaded to cloud environments.

The project implements:
- **Symmetric encryption** to encrypt a text file.
- **Decryption** functionality to retrieve the original data.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the required Python libraries.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-cloud-cryptography.git
   cd secure-cloud-cryptography
